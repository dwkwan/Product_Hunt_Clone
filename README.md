This is a basic clone of the web application Product Hunt. Like Product Hunt, it allows people to view details about tech products including descriptions of them and how popular they are (based on user upvoting). Upon logging in, a user may submit a new product to be displayed on the web application and upvote tech products that others have added.

## Inspiration

As someone new to the Django web framework, I wanted to create a web application that would help me understand the basics. I created this app based on [Nick Walter's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-django-django-2-python-web-dev-website/). This project helped me understand how to design URLs, write views, and design templates.

## Getting Started

To use the site, visit bit.ly/productpunt. To install it, simply clone this repository. You can start the app by running `python manage.py runserver` within the project root directory. Please refer to `requirements.txt` for dependencies.

## Features

### **Sign Up / Login / Logout**

A user may sign up for an account. Upon logging in, they may submit products to be put on the web site and upvote products that other users have submitted. In addition, a user may logout.

### **Product Details**

A user may select a product from the homepage to view details about it including who submitted it ("Hunted By"), the date it was submitted, and a brief description of the product.

### **Product Submission**

A logged-in user can visit the "Create" page to submit a product by providing the necessary details (shown below).

### **Product Upvoting**

A logged-in user can upvote a product from the homepage or when viewing the details for a product.

## Future

Beyond this basic clone, I would like to add additional features that are part of the actual Product Hunt web application including enabling product reviews and displaying product related to the one currently being viewed. Please let me know if you have any feedback.
