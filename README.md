This is a basic clone of the web application Product Hunt. Like Product Hunt, it allows people to view details about tech products including descriptions of them and how popular they are (based on user upvoting). Upon logging in, a user may submit a new product to be displayed on the web application and upvote tech products that others have added.

## Inspiration

As someone new to the Django web framework, I wanted to create a web application that would help me understand the basics. I created this app based on ![Nick Walter's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-django-django-2-python-web-dev-website). This project helped me understand how to cohesively design URLs, write views, and design templates.
